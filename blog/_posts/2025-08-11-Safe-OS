## Introduction
Introduction about OS on AKS and the importance of staying up to date on OS versions

## Challenges in Upgrading OS Versions
Challenges in upgrading os versions (possibility of breakage and no way to downgrade k8s version aka cgroupsv2, problem of OS support ending during LTS)

## AKS Recommendations
Use default if you want easy, no touch experience. Use versioned enums if you want control and reducing risk.

### Scenario 1: A new OS version is available and I want to test it out 

### Scenario 2: I'm using the default OS version and during the k8s version upgrade my workload broke due to underlying OS version changes. I need to rollback my OS version.

### Scenario 3: I'm using LTS and I want and/or need to upgrade my OS version, but want to stay on my LTS k8s version.

## Considerations
Considerations and limitations

## What's Next?
how we are using this in future os releases for example linux guard, AzLinux 4, etc.
