## Introduction

The Azure Linux container host is a secure operating system image that's optimized for running container workloads on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). 
Every three years, Azure Linux releases a major image version containing new packages and package versions, an updated kernel, and enhancements to security, tooling, performance, and developer experience. 
The latest release, Azure Linux 3.0, has been Generally Available on AKS since April 2025. Responding to customer feedback, the AKS and Azure Linux teams are excited to now offer the AzureLinux3 OS SKU, allowing you to migrate existing node pools from Azure Linux 2.0 to 3.0 without upgrading your Kubernetes versionâ€”streamlining adoption of the newest features while maintaining cluster stability.
